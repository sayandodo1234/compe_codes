// Harshit knows by his resources that this time the winning lottery number is the smallest number whose sum of the digits is S and the number of digits is D. You have to help Harshit and print the winning lottery number.
// Input Format
// The Input line contains two space-separated integers: S,D
// Output Format
// The output contains a single integer denoting the winning lottery number
// Constraints
// 1 <= D <= 1000
// 1 <= S <= 9*D
// Time Limit: 1 second
// Sample Input1:
// 9 2
// Sample Output1:
// 18
// Explanation
// There are many other possible numbers like 45, 54, 90, etc with the sum of digits as 9 and number of digits as 2. The smallest of them is 18.
